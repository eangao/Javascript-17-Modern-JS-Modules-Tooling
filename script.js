// Let's start a section with a general overview
// of Modern JavaScript Development.
// So basically of how we write JavaScript today.

// Because when we built applications,
// we don't just write all of our code into one big script
// send that script as it is to the browser,
// and call it a day.
// Now it used to be like this,
// but the way we built JavaScript applications,
// has changed tremendously over the last couple of years.

// So back in the day,
// we used to write all our codes
// into one big script or maybe multiple scripts.
// But today, we divide our projects into multiple modules
// and these modules can share data between them
// and make our code more organized and maintainable.

// Now, one great thing about modules
// is that we can also include 3rd-party modules
// into our own code.
// And there are thousands of open source modules,
// which we also call packages,
// that developers share on the NPM repository.

// And we can then use these packages for free in our own code.
// For example, the popular React framework or jQuery,
// or even the Leaflet library,
// that we used before in our Mapty project.
